# Personal Workspace

This folder is for your own learning artifacts while taking the course.

- `excalidraw/`: diagrams, maps, and exports from your learning sessions.
- `notes/`: summaries, open questions, and checkpoints.

Keep this folder scoped to your learning process and avoid modifying official lesson assets unless needed for exercises.
