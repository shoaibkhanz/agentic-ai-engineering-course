### Candidate Web-Search Queries

1. What are the core layers and components of the modern “AI Engineering stack” according to recent industry whitepapers, academic publications, or standards bodies?
Reason: Supplies authoritative references for Section 2’s explanation of the Application / Model / Infrastructure layers and how they interrelate.

2. Which published case studies or enterprise reports quantify business or user-experience gains after migrating from single-turn LLM calls to autonomous agentic systems built with frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, or the OpenAI Agents SDK?
Reason: Provides concrete evidence for Section 3’s discussion of the shift to agentic systems and their real-world impact.

3. What skills, tools, and evaluation techniques do hiring managers and expert practitioners list as must-have competencies for AI engineers who build and maintain autonomous agents in 2025?
Reason: Backs Section 1’s “Essential Skills” list with data from job-market analyses and expert commentary.

4. What best-practice guidelines do large tech companies or LLMOps tooling providers give for observability, debugging, latency optimization, and cost control when running multi-step LLM agents in production?
Reason: Supports the Production Considerations subsection by adding authoritative guidance on monitoring and cost management.

5. How do recent benchmark papers compare advanced “reasoning models” such as DeepSeek-R1, Llama Nemotron Ultra, and o4-mini for planning and decision-making in autonomous agents, and what architectural features are credited for their performance?
Reason: Supplies evidence for Section 3’s mention of using stronger reasoning models as the “brains” of agentic systems.
