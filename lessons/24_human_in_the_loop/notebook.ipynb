      "### A pragmatic guide to choosing the right architecture for your AI application.\n",
      "\n",
      "When building AI applications, engineers face a critical architectural decision early in their development process. Should you create a predictable, step-by-step workflow where you control every action, or should you build an autonomous agent that can think and decide for itself? This is one of the key decisions that will impact everything from development time and costs to reliability and user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose the wrong approach, and you might end up with an overly rigid system that breaks when users deviate from expected patterns. Or you could build an unpredictable agent that works brilliantly 80% of the time but fails catastrophically when it matters most. Either path can lead to months of wasted development time, frustrated users, and executives questioning the skyrocketing operational costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the real world of 2024 and 2025, billion-dollar AI startups succeed or fail based primarily on this architectural decision. The successful companies, teams, and AI engineers know when to use workflows versus agents and, more importantly, how to combine both approaches effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson will provide a framework to help you make this critical decision with confidence. We will systematically explore the spectrum from rigid workflows to autonomous agents, helping you understand the trade-offs. By the end, you will have the knowledge to architect AI systems that are not only powerful but also robust, efficient, and safe.\n",

      "## Understanding the Spectrum: From Workflows to Agents\n",

      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks that involves LLM calls or other operations, such as reading from a database or writing to a file system. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code. The steps are defined in advance, resulting in deterministic or rule-based paths with predictable execution and explicit control flow. Think of it like a factory assembly line, where each station performs a specific, repeatable task in a set order.\n",

      "On the other end of the spectrum, we have AI agents. These are systems where an LLM plays a central role in dynamically deciding the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The steps are not defined in advance but are planned based on the task and the current state of the environment. This makes them adaptive and capable of handling novelty. You can think of an agent as a skilled human expert tackling an unfamiliar problem, adapting their approach with each new piece of information.\n",

      "### A pragmatic guide to choosing the right architecture for your AI application.\n",
      "\n",
      "When building AI applications, engineers face a key architectural decision. Should you create a predictable, step-by-step workflow where you control every action, or should you build an autonomous agent that can think and decide for itself? This choice impacts development time, costs, reliability, and user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing the wrong approach can lead to an overly rigid system that breaks with unexpected user input. Or you might build an unpredictable agent that works well most of the time but fails when it matters most. Both paths can result in wasted development time and increased operational costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson provides a framework to help you make this decision. We will explore the spectrum from rigid workflows to autonomous agents, understanding their trade-offs. By the end, you will have the knowledge to architect AI systems that are powerful, efficient, and safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understanding the Spectrum: From Workflows to Agents\n",
      "\n",
      "To choose between workflows and agents, you need a clear understanding of what they are. We will look at their core properties and how they function.\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks involving LLM calls or other operations, like reading from a database. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code. The steps are defined in advance, resulting in deterministic paths with predictable execution and explicit control flow. For example, a workflow might always classify an email, then extract entities, and finally log the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "```mermaid\n",
      "graph TD\n",
      "    A[\"Input\"] --> B[\"tool_calling_llm\"]\n",

      "    C --> D[\"End\"]\n",
      "```\n",

(Source [Exploring the difference between agents and workflows](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/llmops-for-production-agentic-rag))\n",
      "\n",
      "AI agents are systems where an LLM plays a central role in dynamically deciding the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The steps are not defined in advance but are planned based on the task and the current state of the environment. This makes them adaptive and capable of handling new situations. An agent might decide to search the web, then summarize findings, and then ask a clarifying question, all based on its ongoing reasoning.\n",

      "\n",
      "Both workflows and agents require an orchestration layer, but its role differs. In a workflow, the orchestrator executes a predefined plan. In an agentic system, the orchestrator facilitates the LLM's dynamic planning and execution. We will explore advanced workflow patterns like chaining and routing in future lessons, as well as the core components of agents like tools, memory, and the ReAct framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Choosing Your Path\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous section, we defined LLM workflows and AI agents. Now, we will explore their core difference: developer-defined logic versus LLM-driven autonomy in reasoning and action selection. Most real-world systems are not purely one or the other; they exist on a spectrum. The key is to find the right balance for your specific use case.\n",

      "\n",
      "Workflows are best for tasks with clearly defined steps. Examples include pipelines for data extraction and transformation from sources like the web, Slack, Zoom, Notion, and Google Drive. They are also good for automated report or email generation and content repurposing. Workflows offer predictability, reliability, and easier debugging. They can also have lower operational costs by using smaller, specialized models. However, they can require more development time and offer a rigid user experience that struggles with unexpected scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agents excel at open-ended research, dynamic problem-solving like debugging code, and interactive tasks in new environments, such as booking a flight without specifying exact sites. Their strength is adaptability and flexibility in handling ambiguity. The downside is that this autonomy makes them less predictable and more prone to errors. Performance, latency, and costs can vary with each run. Agents often require more powerful LLMs, leading to higher costs. If not designed well, they can pose security risks, especially with write operations, potentially deleting data or sending inappropriate emails. Agents are also challenging to debug and evaluate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most real-world systems blend elements of both. Think of it as an \"autonomy slider\" where you decide how much control to give the LLM versus the user. Andrej Karpathy showed this concept in his talks on software in the AI era [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5mdI_aBC4Y). For example, a code editor like Cursor offers different levels of autonomy: simple tab completion (low autonomy), refactoring a selected block of code (medium autonomy), or letting the AI modify the entire repository (high autonomy).\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is to accelerate the loop between AI generation and human verification. This is often achieved through a well-designed architecture that combines the reliability of workflows with the flexibility of agents, supported by an intuitive user interface.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Conclusion: The Challenges of Every AI Engineer\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you understand the spectrum from LLM workflows to AI agents, it is important to recognize that this architectural choice determines whether your AI application succeeds or fails in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an AI engineer, you will face common issues:\n",
      "- **Data Integration:** Building pipelines to pull information from Slack, web APIs, SQL databases, and data lakes. You must ensure only high-quality data reaches your AI system, following the garbage-in, garbage-out principle.\n",
      "- **Cost-Performance Trap:** Sophisticated agents deliver impressive results but can cost a lot per user interaction, making them economically unfeasible for many applications.\n",
      "- **Security Concerns:** Autonomous agents with powerful write permissions could send wrong emails, delete important files, or expose sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "These challenges are solvable. In Lesson 3, we will explore the foundations of AI agents and workflows: context engineering. We will cover patterns for building reliable products through specialized evaluation and monitoring pipelines. We will also explore strategies for building hybrid systems and techniques for keeping costs and latency under control.\n",

      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks orchestrated by developer-written code. It can include LLM calls, but also other operations like reading from a database or calling an API. Think of it like a recipe where each step is explicitly defined. The key characteristic is that the path is determined in advance, resulting in a deterministic or rule-based system. This gives you predictable execution, explicit control over the application's flow, and makes the system easier to test and debug. Because you control every step, you know exactly where a failure occurred and how to fix it.\n",

Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "\n",
      "Before we can choose between workflows and agents, we need a clear understanding of what they are. Rather than focusing on the technical specifics, let's look at their core properties and how they function in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks that involves LLM calls or other operations, such as reading from a database or writing to a file system. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code. The steps are defined in advance, resulting in deterministic or rule-based paths with predictable execution and explicit control flow. Think of it like a factory assembly line, where each station performs a specific, repeatable task in a set order.\n",
      "\n",
      "```mermaid\n",
      "graph TD\n",
      "    A[\"Input\"] --> B[\"tool_calling_llm\"]\n",
      "    B --> C[\"Tools\"]\n",
      "    C --> D[\"End\"]\n",
      "```\n",
      "Image 1: A simple LLM workflow illustrating a sequence of predefined tasks, where an input leads to a tool-calling LLM, which interacts with tools before the workflow ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, we have AI agents. These are systems where an LLM plays a central role in dynamically deciding the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The steps are not defined in advance but are planned based on the task and the current state of the environment. This makes them adaptive and capable of handling novelty. You can think of an agent as a skilled human expert tackling an unfamiliar problem, adapting their approach with each new piece of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "```mermaid\n",
      "graph TD\n",
      "    A[\"Start\"] --> B[\"Agent: Initial Request/State\"]\n",

      "Image 2: A simple agentic system illustrating dynamic decision-making and tool usage with an assistant orchestrating the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both workflows and agents require an orchestration layer, but its role differs significantly. In a workflow, the orchestrator executes a predefined plan, like a conductor following a musical score. In an agentic system, the orchestrator facilitates the LLM's dynamic planning and execution, acting more like a jazz ensemble leader who guides improvisation. We will explore advanced workflow patterns like chaining, routing, and the orchestrator-worker model in future lessons, as well as the core components of agents like tools, memory, and the ReAct framework.\n",

    "\n",
    "Brown includes a command-line interface that lets you interact with the MCP server directly from your terminal. This is useful for scripting, automation, and quick testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI script is located at `lessons/writing_workflow/scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py` and provides three main commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **generate-article**: Generate an article from scratch\n",
    "2. **edit-article**: Edit an entire article based on human feedback\n",
    "3. **edit-selected-text**: Edit a selected section of an article\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ You can run these only from the Brown standalone project from `lessons/writing_workflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the CLI commands look like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Generate an article\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py generate-article --dir-path /path/to/article\n",
    "\n",
    "# Edit an entire article\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py edit-article \\\n",
    "    --dir-path /path/to/article \\\n",
    "    --human-feedback \"Improve the introduction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Edit selected text\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py edit-selected-text \\\n",
    "    --dir-path /path/to/article \\\n",
    "    --human-feedback \"Make this clearer\" \\\n",
    "    --first-line 10 \\\n",
