    "# Lesson 24: Human-in-the-Loop for Brown Writing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore how to implement human-in-the-loop capabilities in the Brown writing workflow. We'll learn how to integrate human feedback into the article review and editing process, expose the workflows as MCP tools for seamless integration with AI assistants like Claude and Cursor, and create a collaborative writing experience where AI and human expertise combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the importance of human feedback and human-in-the-loop in AI writing workflows\n",
    "- Learn how to implement the HumanFeedback entity and integrate it into the ArticleReviewer node\n",
    "- Explore two new editing workflows: edit article and edit selected text\n",
    "- Discover how to expose Brown as an MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources\n",
    "- See how to integrate Brown with MCP clients like Cursor for a coding-like writing experience\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> 💡 Remember that you can also run `brown` as a standalone Python package by going to `lessons/writing_workflow/` and following the instructions from there."

    "\n",
    "After generating an article using the writing workflow we explained in Lessons 22 and 23, you'll likely want to refine it further. Writing is highly subjective, and even the best AI-generated content benefits from human review and editing.\n",

    "We designed Brown to easily introduce humans into the loop between generating the first version of an article and refining it through additional review and editing cycles with human feedback. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can use a low number of review loops during initial article generation to reduce costs and latency\n",
    "2. After reviewing the generated article, we can dynamically run additional review and editing workflows with human feedback\n",
    "3. We can edit either the entire article or just selected sections based on your needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoupling Workflows with MCP\n",

    "To enable this human-in-the-loop approach, we needed to decouple the article generation workflow from the editing workflows. We used MCP servers to achieve this separation, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `generate_article` workflow is one independent MCP tool\n",
    "- The `edit_article` workflow is another independent MCP tool\n",
    "- The `edit_selected_text` workflow is a third independent MCP tool\n",

      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks that involves LLM calls or other operations, such as reading from a database or writing to a file system. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code. The steps are defined in advance, resulting in deterministic or rule-based paths with predictable execution and explicit control flow. Think of it like a factory assembly line, where each station performs a specific, repeatable task in a set order.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, we have AI agents. These are systems where an LLM plays a central role in dynamically deciding the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The steps are not defined in advance but are planned based on the task and the current state of the environment. This makes them adaptive and capable of handling novelty. You can think of an agent as a skilled human expert tackling an unfamiliar problem, adapting their approach with each new piece of information.\n",

In a workflow, the orchestrator executes a predefined plan, like a conductor following a musical score. In an agentic system, the orchestrator facilitates the LLM's dynamic planning and execution, acting more like a jazz ensemble leader who guides improvisation.

      "Before you can choose between workflows and agents, you need a clear understanding of what they are. Rather than focusing on the technical specifics, let's look at their core properties and how they function in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks that involves LLM calls or other operations, such as reading from a database or writing to a file system. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code. These systems often leverage patterns like chaining, routing, and orchestrator-worker models to manage complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps in a workflow are defined in advance, resulting in deterministic or rule-based paths with predictable execution and explicit control flow. As illustrated in Image 1, you can think of it like a factory assembly line, where each station performs a specific, repeatable task in a set order.\n",

      "Image 1: A simple LLM workflow illustrating a sequence of predefined tasks, where an input leads to a classification LLM, which then routes to specific LLM calls before the workflow ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, we have AI agents. These are systems where an LLM plays a central role in dynamically deciding the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. They often incorporate tools, memory, and follow frameworks like ReAct to achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps are not defined in advance but are planned based on the task and the current state of the environment. This makes them adaptive and capable of handling novelty. As shown in Image 2, you can think of an agent as a skilled human expert addressing an unfamiliar problem, adapting their approach with each new piece of information.\n",

This allows for greater flexibility and adaptation to unforeseen circumstances.

    "2. **edit-article**: Edit an entire article based on human feedback\n",
    "3. **edit-selected-text**: Edit a selected section of an article\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "First change your directory to `lessons/writing_workflow` and then you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Generate an article\n",

    "# Edit an entire article\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py edit-article \\\n",
    "    --dir-path /path/to/article \\\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Human-in-the-Loop**: We learned how to design AI workflows that balance automation with human expertise, allowing AI to handle heavy lifting while keeping humans in control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edit Article Workflow**: We implemented the `edit_article` workflow that reviews and edits entire articles based on human feedback and expected requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edit Selected Text Workflow**: We built the `edit_selected_text` workflow for precise, focused edits on specific article sections\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MCP Server**: We served Brown as an MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources while respecting clean architecture principles\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cursor Integration**: We learned how to integrate Brown with Cursor to create a coding-like writing experience with human-in-the-loop editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we can use a low number of review loops during initial article generation, then dynamically run additional editing workflows with human feedback when necessary. This approach is both efficient and effective."

    "\n",
    "1. **Hook Brown to Claude Desktop**: Instead of using Cursor, integrate Brown with Claude Desktop for a different AI assistant experience\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Resource Templates** to parameterize the writing profiles and easily add support for all the available profiles. [More here](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources#resource-templates).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Serve Brown through FastAPI**: Replace the MCP server with a FastAPI REST API for web-based integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Guideline Review Tool**: Create a workflow to review and edit your article guidelines themselves, helping you refine your inputs"
