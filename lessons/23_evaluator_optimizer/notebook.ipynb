    "\n",
    "Before diving into the implementation, let's understand how the writing agent now incorporates the review-editing process through the evaluator-optimizer pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Extended Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 22, we learned about the three-step workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Context into Memory** - Gather guidelines, research, profiles, and examples\n",
    "2. **Generate Media Items** - Use the orchestrator-worker pattern to create diagrams\n",
    "3. **Write the Article** - Generate the first draft using the ArticleWriter\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're adding a fourth and fifth step that loops multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review the Article** (Evaluator) - Check the article against all profiles and guidelines\n",
    "5. **Edit the Article** (Optimizer) - Fix all identified issues based on the reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "This review-edit pattern continues for a configurable number of iterations, gradually improving the article quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluator-optimizer pattern is a fundamental AI workflow pattern that mirrors real-world quality assurance processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluator**: Analyzes output and identifies issues or areas for improvement\n",
    "- **Optimizer**: Takes the feedback and makes targeted improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case:\n",
    "- **Article Reviewer Node** = Evaluator (checks if article follows all the standards)\n",
    "- **Article Writer Node** = Optimizer (edits the article based on reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is extremely similar to how a real-world writing process works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The writer writes the article (initial draft)\n",
    "2. A reviewer provides feedback from outside eyes\n",
    "3. The same writer edits the article based on the provided feedback\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2-3 until satisfied"

    "\"article_profile\", \"structure_profile\", \"mechanics_profile\", \"terminology_profile\", \"tonality_profile\")\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. The Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern:**\n",
    "- Evaluator (ArticleReviewer) identifies issues against requirements\n",
    "- Optimizer (ArticleWriter) fixes issues based on feedback\n",
    "- Iterative refinement gradually improves quality\n",
    "- Transparent, debuggable, and improvable process\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Centralized Configuration:**\n",
    "- Single YAML file controls everything\n",
    "- Per-node model and parameter configuration\n",
    "- Easy experimentation and optimization\n",
    "- Type-safe with Pydantic validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. LangGraph Integration:**\n",
    "- Workflow orchestration with Function API\n",
    "- Task-based architecture with retry policies\n",
    "- Checkpointing for state persistence\n",
    "- Streaming for progress reporting\n",
    "- Production-ready error handling\n"

    "**1. Different AI Frameworks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace LangGraph Function API with LangGraph Graph API. Try PydanticAI or other frameworks. The clean architecture makes swapping easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Improve the Reviewer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Play around with the reviewer, get a feeling of how it extract the reviews from the profiles and tweak either the profiles or the reviewer for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Modify the configuration:**\n",
    "\n",

    "In **Lesson 24: Human-in-the-Loop**, we'll explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding two new workflows for iteratively editing the whole article or just a selected piece of text.\n",
    "- Properly add humans in the loop between the generated article and future edit iterations.\n",
    "- Expose the workflows as MCP tools.\n",
